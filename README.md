## Overview

Making this daily planner was an engaging way to try and implement what I am currently learning into a real world application. 
Right now I am trying to learn how to read third party api's better, specifically Bootstrap and jQuery.

## Bootstrap

Bootstrap allowed me to quickly and easily add a lot of UI tools to the document. What would be a painful planning task to do a month ago I can add or exchange high quality components within seconds which allows me to focus on the smaller details of the project, such as how the page is arranged. 

## JQuery

JQuery is a powerful third party HTML selector tool for JavaScript that is commonly used throughout industry, so I thought I would try to replicate the selectors and event listenors I have been using the last few weeks with their corresponding componenets. The process took much longer than if I had just used what I have learned, but I now feel very comfortable with the faster and more streamlined process that is JQuery. This, in my opinion, was a good use of my time to learn a powerful tool that will speed up my coding for future projects.

## Conclusion

This project is a culmination of what I have learned in the last month and a half with what I am currently working on. It has timer, HTML, and JavaScript from previous projects while adding in third party apis such as Bootstrap, JQuery, and Moment.
